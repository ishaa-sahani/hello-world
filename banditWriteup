Commands used: ls, cat
If a filename begins with a dash (-), '<' is used before its name.
For example, if the filename is -file01, the command would be cat <-file01.

If a filename has spaces, the entire filename in the commands has to be written inside double quotations.

Level 3
Commands used: ls, cat, cd, ls -a
ls -a command shows us thr hidden files also.

Level 4
Commands used: file
We can use a loop to check for each file and find the password. The command would be: for in x {0..9}; do ./-file0$x; done
Or, if we want to check for each file individually, we can use the command: file ./-file01

Level 5:
This level has a lot of folders. If we start opening them using cat, we get a huge chunk of garbage.
